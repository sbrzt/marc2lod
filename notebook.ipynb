    "# From MARC to LOD: Mining and Publishing Linked Open Bibliographic Data with Python \n",

    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC, while widely used, presents challenges in terms of accessibility, interoperability, and integration with modern data ecosystems. The conversion to Linked Open Data (LOD) addresses these challenges, offering a paradigm shift that enhances the discoverability, reusability, and interconnectedness of bibliographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the process of transitioning from MARC records to LOD using Python. Our primary focus will be on the [dardwinslibrary](https://archive.org/details/darwinslibrary) collection, a scholarly edition of Darwin's scientific archive. In particular, we will go through each stage of the process and address its complexities, from extracting bibliographic records from the Internet Archive to utilizing Python for data cleansing and preparation, ultimately facilitating their conversion into Linked Open Data. Whether you are an experienced data professional or new to Python programming, this tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of bibliographic data manipulation."

    "## Step 01: Import needed libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial step of our data conversion process, we begin by importing essential Python libraries for carrying out the process:\n",
    "* `os`: This library provides a platform-independent interface for interacting with the operating system, facilitating tasks such as file and directory operations.\n",
    "* `re`: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. The 're' library empowers us to efficiently navigate and extract relevant information from our MARC records.\n",
    "* `pymarc`: Central to our mission, the 'pymarc' library allows us to work with MARC data effortlessly. Its functionality enables parsing, editing, and processing MARC records, essential for our data mining endeavors.\n",
    "* `internetarchive` (`ia`): Leveraging the 'internetarchive' library grants us seamless access to the Internet Archive, a rich repository of bibliographic records. This connection is fundamental for retrieving the data from the specified collection.\n",
    "* `pandas` (`pd`): As a robust data manipulation and analysis library, 'pandas' is indispensable for organizing, cleaning, and transforming our data.\n",
    "* `missingno` (`msgno`): Data quality is paramount, and 'missingno' aids us in visualizing missing data patterns within our dataset."

It consists of rows and columns, similar to a table or spreadsheet, where each column can have a different data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings) and is labeled with a unique name. DataFrames are versatile data structures commonly used for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration in data science and machine learning tasks.

    "Splendid. Now we are aware of some other important aspects of our data. For example, considering the number of rows (_and thus values per column_) is 315, we can notice how some values are missing: as a matter of fact, only `TITLE` and `NOTE` are completely populated. Moreover, now we also know that `ID` values are not unique. To be more precise: 34 identifiers (264-230) are _not_ unique. Moreover, we also get some interesting tidbits about the most frequent values within the dataset: `Kirby2006fz26R.` (`ID`, 4 times); `Lyell1837jf09J_MS` (`SUPP_MATERIAL`, 4 times); `London` (`PUB_PLACE`, 68 times); `John Murray` (`PUBLISHER`, 11 times); and so on. Of course, these are the values _before_ data cleaning, so this information could still be subject to change."

    "## Step 06: Data cleaning\n",
    "This takes us to the next phase: cleaning our dataset squeaky clean! Or, at least, try to. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving the identification, correction, and removal of inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in datasets. This process ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and reliable for further analysis. Common data cleaning tasks include handling missing values, correcting data entry errors, standardizing formats, removing duplicate records, and dealing with outliers. In our case, cleaning our data means dealing with all the abnormalities we highlighted above. We will use more Python functions to deal with those by running them for each dictionary in `data`. \n",
