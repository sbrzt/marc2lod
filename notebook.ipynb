    "# From MARC to LOD: Mining and Publishing Linked Open Bibliographic Data with Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) is a widely used standard for the representation and exchange of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form. (https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/concise/bdintro.html) Developed by Henriette Avram at the Library of Congress between the 1965 and the 1968, MARC provided a framework for organizing bibliographic data (such as physical description, publication information, notes, and so on) and facilitating the management and retrieval of various bibliographic materials, ranging from textual objects to geographic maps, music, and even software. By the half of the next decade, MARC formats were everywhere and became the _de facto_ standard for structuring and publishing bibliographic data. (Avram, H. D. (1975). MARC; its History and Implications. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED127954.pdf)"

    "The MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record: the field designations within each record, the structure of the record, and the actual content of the record itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific information about the item being described can be communicated through field labels in a MARC record. These labels can include things like the author, title, publication information, and more. Each field in a record is identified with a straightforward three-digit numeric code that runs from 001 to 999. For example, field 100 designates the work's principal author, field 245 the title, and field 260 the publication information. Eventual subfields are designated using single letters or numeric labels. Field 260, for instance, has several subfields, like \"a\" for the publication location, \"b\" for the publisher, and \"c\" for the publication date.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC records are frequently concatenated into a single file and are normally stored and sent as binary files. Every data set has a framework that describes how the elements are arranged and conforms to ISO 2709 standards. This structure consists of an initial set of characters that serve as a directory for finding fields and subfields within the record, as well as a marker that indicates the start and finish of each record. An important note that will be useful later: MARC records can now be represented in XML format thanks to the MARCXML schema, developed as an alternative structure in which the fields themselves are represented using XML markup while staying conceptually the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "MARC records information about a bibliographic item by emphasizing its metadata over its actual content. As such, it serves as a metadata transfer standard as opposed to a content standard. Only the contents of a few fixed fields are specified by the MARC standards themselves; thus, the specific data entered into each MARC field are usually determined by external standards, such as RDA for physical descriptions and LCSH for subject terms."

    "While MARC21 has been a cornerstone of library cataloging for decades, it also comes with several notable issues and challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity: MARC21 is known for its complexity, which can make it difficult for catalogers to learn and use effectively. The intricacies of MARC coding and the wide range of fields and subfields can lead to errors and inconsistencies in cataloging practices.\n",
    "* Limited Data Structure: MARC21's structure was designed in an era when physical cards were used for cataloging, leading to limitations in representing modern digital resources and complex metadata. It may not fully accommodate the needs of digital collections, multimedia resources, or non-traditional materials.\n",
    "* Data Redundancy: MARC records often contain redundant information, with data repeated across multiple fields and subfields. This redundancy can increase the size of records and make them less efficient for storage and retrieval.\n",
    "* Interoperability Challenges: While MARC21 is widely used, its complexity and variations between implementations can create challenges for interoperability between library systems and consortia. Different interpretations of MARC standards by different institutions can lead to inconsistencies in data exchange.\n",
    "* Limited Support for Linked Data: MARC21 was developed before the concept of linked data gained prominence. As a result, it lacks native support for linked data principles and semantic web technologies, making it challenging to integrate MARC records into linked data environments.\n",
    "* Maintenance and Evolution: The maintenance and evolution of MARC standards require coordinated efforts from the library community and standardization bodies. Updates to MARC21 can be slow, and the standard may struggle to keep pace with evolving technologies and user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, MARC21 continues to be widely used in library environments due to its established infrastructure and compatibility with existing systems. However, there is ongoing discussion within the library community about the need for alternative metadata standards and approaches that better align with modern library practices and emerging technologies."

We will use the [dardwinslibrary](https://archive.org/details/darwinslibrary) collection, a scholarly edition of Darwin's scientific archive, as an exemplary case study. In particular, we will go through each stage of the process and address its complexities, from extracting bibliographic records from the Internet Archive to leveraging Python for data cleansing and preparation, ultimately facilitating their conversion into Linked Open Data. Whether you are an experienced data professional or new to Python programming, this tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of bibliographic data manipulation."

    "* `pandas` (`pd`): As a robust data manipulation and analysis library, 'pandas' is indispensable for organizing, cleaning, and transforming our data.\n",
    "* `missingno` (`msgno`): Data quality is paramount, and 'missingno' aids us in visualizing missing data patterns within our dataset."

It consists of rows and columns, similar to a table or spreadsheet, where each column can have a different data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings) and is labeled with a unique name. DataFrames are versatile data structures commonly used for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration in data science and machine learning tasks. They offer powerful methods and functions for data indexing, slicing, filtering, grouping, joining, and more, making them a popular choice for working with structured data in Python."

    "Splendid. Now we are aware of some other important aspects of our data. For example, considering the number of rows (_and thus values per column_) is 315, we can notice how some values are missing: as a matter of fact, only `TITLE` and `NOTE` are completely populated. Moreover, now we also know that `ID` values are not unique. To be more precise: 34 identifiers (264-230) are _not_ unique. Moreover, we also get some interesting tidbits about the most frequent values within the dataset: `Kirby2006fz26R.` (`ID`, 4 times); `Lyell1837jf09J_MS` (`SUPP_MATERIAL`, 4 times); `London` (`PUB_PLACE`, 68 times); `John Murray` (`PUBLISHER`, 11 times); and so on. Of course, these are the values _before_ data cleaning, so this information could still be subject to change."

    "This takes us to the next phase: cleaning our dataset squeaky clean! Or, at least, try to. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, involving the identification, correction, and removal of inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in datasets. This process ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and reliable for further analysis. Common data cleaning tasks include handling missing values, correcting data entry errors, standardizing formats, removing duplicate records, and dealing with outliers. In our case, cleaning our data means dealing with all the abnormalities we highlighted above. We will use more Python functions to deal with those by running them for each dictionary in `data`. \n",
