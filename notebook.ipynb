    "# From MARC to LOD: Mining and Publishing Linked Open Bibliographic Data with Python \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) is a widely used standard for the representation and exchange of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form. (https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/concise/bdintro.html) Developed by Henriette Avram at the Library of Congress between the 1965 and the 1968, MARC provided a framework for organizing bibliographic data (such as physical description, publication information, notes, and so on) and facilitating the management and retrieval of various bibliographic materials, ranging from textual objects to geographic maps, music, and even software. By the half of the next decade, MARC formats were everywhere and became the _de facto_ standard for structuring and publishing bibliographic data. (Avram, H. D. (1975). MARC; its History and Implications. https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED127954.pdf)"

    "The main benefit of publishing library data as LOD is that it makes data more _attractive_:  it becomes readily available and easier to analyze, combine, integrate, and use for researchers, system developers, librarians, and potentially even for the general public (if done correctly), as consequence of being freed out of conceptual and technical silos (such as MARC).

We will use the [dardwinslibrary](https://archive.org/details/darwinslibrary) collection, a scholarly edition of Darwin's scientific archive, as an exemplary case study. In particular, we will go through each stage of the process and address its complexities, from collecting MARC records from the Internet Archive to leveraging Python for data cleansing, preparation, and conversion into Linked Open Data. In addition, we will do our best to document the whole process in a FAIR, transparent, and reproducible fashion."

    "## Know thy MARC\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting our hands dirty, we first better get to know what we are dealing with. In particular, we must ask ourselves this question: what is _exactly_ a MARC record?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record: \n",
    "* the **field designations** within each record;\n",
    "* the **structure** of the record;\n",
    "* the actual **content** of the record itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "Specific information about the item being described are expressend through **field labels** in a MARC record. These labels can include things like the author, title, publication information, and more. Each field in a record is identified with a straightforward three-digit numeric code that runs from `001` to `999`. For example, field `100` designates the work's `principal author`, field `245` the `title`, and field `260` the `publication information`. Eventual subfields are designated using single letters or numeric labels. Field 260, for instance, has several subfields, like `a` for the `publication location`, `b` for the `publisher`, and `c` for the `publication date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "MARC records are frequently concatenated into a single file and are normally stored and sent as binary files. Every data set has a ISO 2709-compliant framework that describes how the elements are arranged. This structure consists of an initial set of characters that serve as a directory for finding fields and subfields within the record, as well as a marker that indicates the start and finish of each record. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An important note that will be useful later: nowadays, MARC records can be represented in XML format thanks to the **MARCXML** schema, developed as an alternative structure in which the fields themselves are represented using XML markup while staying conceptually the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "MARC records information about a bibliographic item by emphasizing its metadata over its actual content. As such, it serves as a metadata transfer standard as opposed to a content standard. Only the contents of a few fixed fields are specified by the MARC standards themselves; thus, the specific data entered into each MARC field are usually determined by external standards, such as RDA for physical descriptions and LCSH for subject terms."

    "## Import needed libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial step of our data conversion process, we begin by importing essential Python libraries for carrying out the process:\n",
    "* `os`: This library provides a platform-independent interface for interacting with the operating system, facilitating tasks such as file and directory operations.\n",
    "* `re`: Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and string manipulation. The 're' library empowers us to efficiently navigate and extract relevant information from our MARC records.\n",
    "* `pymarc`: Central to our mission, the 'pymarc' library allows us to work with MARC data effortlessly. Its functionality enables parsing, editing, and processing MARC records, essential for our data mining endeavors.\n",
    "* `internetarchive` (`ia`): Leveraging the 'internetarchive' library grants us seamless access to the Internet Archive, a rich repository of bibliographic records. This connection is fundamental for retrieving the data from the specified collection.\n",
    "* `pandas` (`pd`): As a robust data manipulation and analysis library, 'pandas' is indispensable for organizing, cleaning, and transforming our data.\n",
    "* `missingno` (`msgno`): Data quality is paramount, and 'missingno' aids us in visualizing missing data patterns within our dataset.\n",
    "* `pyarrow` (`pa`): ...\n",
    "* `parquet` (`pq`): ...\n",
    "* `json`: ...\n",

For example, considering the number of rows (_and thus values per column_) is 315, we can notice how some values are missing: as a matter of fact, only `TITLE` and `NOTE` are completely populated. Moreover, now we also know that 34 identifiers (264-230) are _not_ unique. Moreover, we also get some interesting tidbits about the most frequent values within the dataset: `Kirby2006fz26R.` (`ID`, 4 times); `Lyell1837jf09J_MS` (`SUPP_MATERIAL`, 4 times); `London` (`PUB_PLACE`, 68 times); `John Murray` (`PUBLISHER`, 11 times); and so on.

    "... but wait! Before getting into data cleaning, we better do our best to follow data management good practices. Themes like FAIR Principles (...) and reproducibility (...) open up whole new worlds to explore, and we certainly do not have the time nor the space to deal with their intricacies right now, but in the meantime it can be useful to pick up from them one suggestion or two about how to make our scientific computing endeavor... well, scientific. \n",

    "An excellent way to start documenting what we are doing is by using metadata (supplementary information that describes another object). Metadata is fundamental in data documentation, since it provides context, such as when, where and how the object it refers to was created. Collection and storage of metadata should be considered a key feature to include in data processing endeavors. In particular, we should attach some metadata to our outputs (such as the DataFrame we just created) in order to track the data lifecycle and thus ensuring transparency in all its stages.\n",

    "[This Darren SMith's article](https://towardsdatascience.com/saving-metadata-with-dataframes-71f51f558d8e) provides an excellent approach to implement this by using **Parquet** (a file format for storing tabular data efficiently) and **Arrow** (a mechanism to store tabular data in memory). We will first use Arrow to convert the DataFrame to an Arrow table and then attach metadata to it. This enriched table will then be saved as a Parquet file. Additionally, we will see how to restore the DataFrame and metadata from the saved file."
